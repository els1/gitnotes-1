```
```bash
git config --global color.ui auto

cd $folder
git init
```

```

# Creating the next version

First view the status to see where things are at

```bash
git status
```

Add the changes you want in the next version (the `-p` option asks 
you change by change and is not required to just add everything)

```bash
git add -p $file
```

If you want to remove a file

```bash
git rm $file
```

# Save the next version

To save the next version run

```bash
git commit
```

For a log message, describe why you made the change, not what 
change you made as the computer can tell you the latter but not 
the former. Make the first line a brief oneline overview.
